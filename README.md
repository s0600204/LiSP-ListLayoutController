The **List Layout Controller** is a community-created plugin for
**[Linux Show Player](https://github.com/FrancescoCeruti/linux-show-player)**

This plugin adds the ability to control various functions in the List Layout
(Go, Stop, Back, Forward, ...) with MIDI voice messages.

Originally authored by *Yinameah*, it has been updated to work with
**Linux Show Player** v0.6 by *s0600204*.

**Note:** This plugin may at some point be superseded by the **controller**
plugin currently in (stalled) development by *offtools*
[here](https://github.com/offtools/linux-show-player/tree/controller-new/lisp/plugins/controller).


### Installation

To use, place the contents in a subfolder of `$XDG_DATA_HOME/linux_show_player/plugins`
(On most Linux systems, this will default to `~/.share/linux_show_player/plugins`.)

When you next start **Linux Show Player**, the program should load the plugin
automatically.
