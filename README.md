The **List Layout Controller** is a community-created plugin for
**[Linux Show Player](https://github.com/FrancescoCeruti/linux-show-player)**

This plugin adds the ability to control various functions in the List Layout
(Go, Stop, Back, Forward, ...) with MIDI voice messages.

Originally authored by *Yinameah*, it has been updated to work with
**Linux Show Player** v0.6 by *s0600204*.

**Note:** This plugin was created before control via MIDI voice message (beyond
Note-On/Off) was implemented in the **Controller** plugin that comes as part
of the base install of **LiSP**. As such, this plugin is now redundant and thus
this repository has been archived.


### Installation

To use, place the contents in a subfolder of `$XDG_DATA_HOME/LinuxShowPlayer/$LiSP_Version/plugins/`
(On most Linux systems, this will default to `~/.local/share/LinuxShowPlayer/0.6/plugins/`.)

When you next start **Linux Show Player**, the program should load the plugin
automatically.
